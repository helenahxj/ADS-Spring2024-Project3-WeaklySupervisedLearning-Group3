+ Project summary: In this project, we created two predictive models to improve on image classification and prediction. The first model is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To achieve better accuracy, we add weakly supervised learning feature (Noise-Robust Loss function) to our first model.....
	
**Contribution statement**: All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. Yerin is responsible for creating the CNN model and train the first model, and Aojie is responsible for adding weakly supervised learning features to the CNN model and train the model to achieving more accurate prediction. Siyu and Xiangjing evaluate the performance of baseline model and two complex model. Siyu further optimized models for better performance. Xiangjing organized relevant doc and push it to the github, edited project and folder description, and presented the results.
