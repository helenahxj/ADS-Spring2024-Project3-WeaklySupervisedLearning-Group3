+ Project summary: In this project, we created two predictive models to improve on image classification and prediction. The first model is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To achieve better accuracy, we add weakly supervised learning feature (Noise-Robust Lossfunction) to our first model and ues iterative method to change the weight for different set.
	
**Contribution statement**: All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. Yerin is responsible for creating the first CNN model and train the first model, and Aojie is responsible for improve the accuracy for our model, by adding weakly supervised learning features to the CNN model and use iterative method to the training set. Xiangjing evaluate the model performance, plot the accuracy and loss for training and validation data, and output the label predicted by all three models. Xiangjing and Siyu split dataset to train the first model and further optimized models for better performance.
